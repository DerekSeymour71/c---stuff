We draw N discs on a plane. The discs are numbered from 0 to N − 1. 
An array A of N non-negative integers, specifying the radiuses of the discs, is given. 
The J-th disc is drawn with its center at (J, 0) and radius A[J].

J-th disc and K-th disc intersect if J ≠ K and the J-th and K-th discs have at least one common point 
(assuming that the discs contain their borders).

The figure below shows discs drawn for N = 6 and A as follows:

  A[0] = 1
  A[1] = 5
  A[2] = 2
  A[3] = 1
  A[4] = 4
  A[5] = 0
  
  My initial thought is, visually, the solution looks pretty simple. However, as per normal, the explanation is not exactly in simple english.
  
  Once you draw this, it looks relatively easy to work it out.
